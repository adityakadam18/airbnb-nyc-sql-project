## 1. Project Title/ Headline
Airbnb NYC 2019 – SQL Data Analysis
This project uses MySQL to analyze the Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset. I imported the data, created tables, and wrote SQL queries to explore trends like average prices, most expensive listings, popular room types, and host activity across New York City.

## 2. Short Description/ purpose 
The goal of this project is to explore and analyze the Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset using SQL. By writing queries in MySQL Workbench, I uncovered insights about pricing, room types, popular neighborhoods, and host listing patterns.

## 3. Tech Stack
The project was build using the following tools and technogies:<br>
 •     🛠️ MySQL Workbench – For executing SQL queries and managing the database.<br>
 •     🐬 MySQL Server – Backend database system for data storage.<br>
 •     📄 CSV File – Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset used for analysis.<br>
 •     💻 SQL – Language used for data manipulation and analysis.<br>

## 4. Data Source 
The dataset used in this project is the Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset, publicly available on Kaggle.

## 5. How to Run the Project
📥 Step 1: Dataset Used
I used the Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset, which is publicly available on Kaggle.
I downloaded the CSV file: AB_NYC_2019.csv.

📥 Step 2: Setting Up the Database
I created a schema named airbnb_nyc in MySQL Workbench and set up a table named listings with the required columns to match the dataset structure.

📤 Step 3: Importing the Data
I imported the CSV file into the listings table using MySQL Workbench’s Table Data Import Wizard:

🔍 Step 4: Running the SQL Queries
Once the data was imported, I wrote and ran several SQL queries in MySQL Workbench to explore the dataset.
These queries helped me analyze average prices, popular neighborhoods, types of rooms, and host activity across New York City.
